Risk...risky business

I wrote one about 10 years ago using VS6, and while it did
"work", well, I have wanted to improve it.
The old one, which was in this repository, has been removed.
If you wanted it, well, sorry.
As of Sept 11, 2022, the files don't do anything.  Just the
MFC skeleton code for the three different portions of the
app.  There is the game, map editor, and AI (for computer opponents).
